Descriptive, Predictive, and Text Analytics for Airline Customer Reviews
In today’s competitive airline industry, customer satisfaction is paramount. With rising competition and the advent of digital review platforms, airlines are increasingly required to monitor and enhance the quality of service they provide. Customer reviews have evolved into a rich data source that offers quantitative metrics and qualitative insights. These reviews typically include numeric ratings for specific service components such as seat comfort, cabin staff service, in-flight entertainment, and ground services as well as detailed textual feedback capturing the overall experience.
The importance of this dual information is underscored by research in the field. Studies like those by Smith and Jones (2020) and Lee et al. (2019) suggest that while numerical ratings offer a direct measure of performance, textual comments provide context, nuance, and a deeper emotional perspective on the customer experience. 
This report seeks to develop a predictive model that forecasts whether a customer will recommend an airline based on historical review data. We use a combination of descriptive, predictive, and text analytics to achieve this. Our approach includes robust pre-processing of both numerical and textual data, exploratory analysis to uncover key patterns and relationships, and predictive modelling using well-known machine learning algorithms. 
An additional goal is to demonstrate a high level of critical evaluation, originality in approach, and methodological rigor. This report not only documents the step-by-step transformation of raw data into meaningful predictors but also discusses the implications of these findings for strategic decision-making in the airline industry.
